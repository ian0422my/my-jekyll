## useradmin

* if user details page is not loading via user listing, just load any other user which works and replace the user path on the url (copy the user path from useradmin)

## space utilization

<http://localhost:4502/etc/reports/diskusage.html?path=/content/dam/test1/subpath>

## logging

* aem use apache sling comons logging (15) which internally uses logback

### Issues

* logging not rolling daily
  * to check, need to enable -Dlogback.debug=true
    * found out that it's caused by RenameUtil.renameTo(which internally uses File.rename)
      * winnt has problem renaming error.log to error.log1 when error.log1 is locked

#### Solution

##### Option 0 - try and see if the log can be release manually(no restart required)

* go to AEM configMgr, then find the log writer for the log
* edit the `Log File Threshold` and change the value from `'.'yyyy-MM-dd` to `'.'yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm`(to rotate eveey minute)
* monitor the log. If current log is rotated to a new file (e.g. error.log.2023-05-23-14-31) then manually rotate is successful
* restore the `Log File Threshold` back to `'.'yyyy-MM-dd` 

##### Option 1 - Find out who is locking the file

* go to Resource manager > CPU > handler > find the file while is not rolling, OR
* talk to security team and check if error.log is being scanned and raised for deviation (not to scan)

##### Options 2 - Use logback

* in order to use logback
  * remove log writer for error.log
  * create sling.home/conf/logback.xml
    * have to make sure that "\<file>" is empty so that logback will not roll
  * configure "Apache Sling logging Configuration" to point to logback.xml
    * once saved, you can verify the settings @ sling.home\launchpad\config\org\apache\sling\commons\log\LogManager.config

##### option 3 - log com.adobe.fd.df.internal to null.log and let null.log roll every 25mb (max 2 files)

* PA set log com.adobe.fd.df.internal to null.log on 20220620. error.log is no more throwing too much error nor facing renaming error.b But is affectng null.log
  * com.adobe.fd.df.internal is thrown when there's "undefined varibale in notice"
    * e.g.
      * Notice.NON_STANDARD_VARIABLE.GROUP_NMAE.TX_S_V805

* 3 phases

  * compaction

      * save most space but need more resources
    * tail
      * fast but save space using the most recent segments and tar files
  * clean up
* type

      * not appearing in production? why?
  * offline
    * need to shutdown aem and run cli (oak-run.jar)

#### Version GC

* new version will be created when ***new page*** are created/activated
* old version will be kept based on the verison defined in "Day CQ WCM Version Manager"

### SQL2

```

## Tools

### Operation

#### Maintenance

<https://blogs.perficient.com/2021/03/08/managing-aem-repository-size-growth/>

## Troubleshooting

### SegmentNotFoundException

* unable to resovle ResourceResolverFactory - aem might be corrupted. Restart and see if can access - if still cannot need to revert to the last good revision

#### Restore Last Good Revision

<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-16457.html?lang=fr-FR>

* find last good revision

```cmd
java -jar oak-run-*.jar check --bin=-1 crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/
```

* remove all lines after /crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/journal.log based on the revision id found
* Remove all ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/*.bak files.
* Run checkpoint clean-up to remove orphaned checkpoints:

```cmd
java -jar oak-run-*.jar checkpoints ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore rm-unreferenced
```

* compact the repository

```cmd
java -jar oak-run-*.jar compact ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/
```

* start AEM

### bundles cannot start properly - check with gogo shell

* sometimes aem cannot start properly, need to use gogoshell to check

```cmd
telnet localhost 11311
```

### unable to join cluster (rdbmk and file data store)

* `... unable to update clusterview... settings ... DATA ... will be truncated...`
* when this happens, means there are nodes which is not shutdown properly, which causes the string for recovery settings became too long (SETTINGS.DATA column is 4000 characters)
* solution

```sql
delete from SETTINGS where dsize in (select dsize from SETTINGS where data like '%clusterview%')
```

* restart all nodes

### aem taking very long (4 hours) to startup and yet, all bundles not able to become all active

* this happen to me when aem forms installation was interuppted half way(aem was shutdown). Some of the packages is not installed (by right it should be installed automatically)
* to resolve this, have to check few things
  * if package manager is accessible and forms is uploaded
    * find all "new packages"(i.e. uploaded, extracted but not installed)
      * install all these packages
        * just make sure no more "new packages" is found inside `package manager`
